Since photo-Z error and redshift distortions bring about unnegligible error along line-of-sight, resulting in loss of most information in that direction, we projected halo catalogs onto a plane. In this project, we proposed the planar tidal reconstruction methodology to deal with projected density field. Currently we have applied this methodology on RedMegic catalog of DES Y1 data and obtained the correspoinding density field.

Next we will calculate the power spectrum and improve cosmology constraints according to this result.
