Asteroid sampling and analysis missions are of great significance to the exploration of the origin of the solar system, the environment of the early solar system, and the distribution of elements.Hayabusa, OSIRIS-REX missions and other asteroid missions have all arranged asteroid soil sampling missions. However, due to some reasons such as the immature asteroid sampling institutions, these missions have encountered some difficulties in the sampling process. Electrostatic sampling is a new sampling technology, which uses electrostatic traveling wave to control the movement of charged soil particles, so as to complete the sampling task with low power and high reliability. In this project, a flexible electrostatic traveling wave sampler is designed and verified on the basis of previous studies. The sampler can tolerate the relative displacement between the detector and the asteroid.
